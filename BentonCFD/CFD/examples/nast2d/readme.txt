This project provides a sample program, that provides a significant
numerical computation, written using a number of languages and
approaches for the sake of comparison.  The sample program is a
slightly modified version of a Navier-Stokes fluid dynamics code by
Griebel et al. [1].

Current implementations include C, Fortran, and Haskell (repa). 

2012/13 - Accelerate (Haskell) and Ypnos (Haskell) implementations in progress.
