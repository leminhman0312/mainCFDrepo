I have modified the program so that DEC/HP/Compaq FORTRAN
can compile it and the executable will run on any 32-bit
or 64-bit version of Windows from W95 through W10.

I have also eliminated the output files that target
LINUX-specific graphic utilities, replacing these with
generic output that can be read by Tecplot or TP2.

Each of the examples comes with a batch file to launch
the program and rename the output files. There is also a
Tecplot layout file for each of the examples to facilitate
visualization of the results.

The latest estimate for LINUX users is 2.18%, which is
tiny indeed. The vast majority of the world runs Windows.
I hope that these modifications will increase the utility
and user base of this fine work by Jiri Blazek, who deseves
all the credit.
