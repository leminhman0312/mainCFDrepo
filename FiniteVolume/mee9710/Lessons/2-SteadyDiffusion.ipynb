    "# Steady One-Dimensional Heat Diffusion\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we explore the solution of the steady, one-dimensional heat diffusion equation, given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ - k\\nabla^2T - S = 0 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that all terms have been brought to the left side of the equation (i.e. the side where the transient term would normally appear) due to our choice of sign convention where $a_P$ coefficients must be positive. It is equally possible to move everything to the right side of the equation (including the transient term), but then $a_P$ coefficients would be required to be negative while $a_{nb}$ coefficients would be required to be positive. It should also be noted that boundary conditions are required to solve this problem; these will be discussed later.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Discretization\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the previous lession, the diffusion term can be discretized as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\int_S \\mathbf{J}\\cdot\\mathbf{n} dS \n",
    "   \\approx \\sum_{i=0}^{N_{ip}-1} \\mathbf{J}_{ip}\\cdot\\mathbf{n}_{ip}A_{ip}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the diffusive flux is $\\mathbf{J} = -k\\nabla T$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\int_S \\mathbf{J}\\cdot\\mathbf{n} dS \n",
    "   = - \\sum_{i=0}^{N_{ip}-1} k_{ip} \\nabla T_{ip} \\cdot\\mathbf{n}_{ip}A_{ip}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, we will assume that the thermal conductivity is constant in space and time, so $k_{ip} = k$ and can be taken outside of the summation. The diagram below shows a one-dimensional control volume, where the unit vectors on each of the faces is shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "![OneDimControlVolume](Figures/2-OneDimControlVolume.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this, the discretized diffusion term may be simplified as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ - \\sum_{i=0}^{N_{ip}-1} k_{ip} \\nabla T_{ip} \\cdot\\mathbf{n}_{ip}A_{ip}\n",
    "   = k \\left. \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} \\right|_w A_w - k \\left. \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} \\right|_e A_e\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "since $\\nabla T\\cdot \\mathbf{i} = \\partial T/\\partial x$. The following diagram defines the cell locations and the nomenclature for the distances between them:\n",
    "\n",
    "![OneDimControlVolumeNomenclature](Figures/2-OneDimControlVolumeNomenclature.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The derivatives in the diffusion term can then be approximated using finite differences, resulting in:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ k \\left. \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} \\right|_w A_w - k \\left. \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} \\right|_e A_e\n",
    "   = k \\frac{T_P - T_W}{\\Delta x_{WP}} A_w - k \\frac{T_E - T_P}{\\Delta x_{PE}} A_e\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The discretized source term is simply:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\int_V S dV \\approx S_P V_P $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $S_P$ is the value of the source term calculated within the cell and $V_P$ is the cell volume. Putting everything together on one side of the equation, we can form the residual for the cell $P$ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ r_P = - k \\frac{T_E - T_P}{\\Delta x_{PE}} A_e + k \\frac{T_P - T_W}{\\Delta x_{WP}} A_w - S_P V_P $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also express in terms of diffusive fluxes through each face, $F^d$, as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ r_P = F^d_e - F^d_w - S_P V_P $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F^d_e = - k \\frac{T_E - T_P}{\\Delta x_{PE}} A_e = - D_e \\left(T_E - T_P\\right) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F^d_w = - k \\frac{T_P - T_W}{\\Delta x_{WP}} A_w = - D_w \\left(T_P - T_W\\right) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the coefficeints $D_e$ and $D_w$ are defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ D_e = \\frac{k A_e}{\\Delta x_{PE}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ D_w = \\frac{k A_w}{\\Delta x_{WP}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The cell residual is then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ r_P = D_w \\left(T_P - T_W\\right) - D_e \\left(T_E - T_P\\right) - S_P V_P $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We then calculate the linearization coefficients as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ a_P = \\frac{\\partial r_P}{\\partial T_P} = D_w + D_e - \\frac{\\partial S_P}{\\partial T_P} V_P$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ a_W = \\frac{\\partial r_P}{\\partial T_W} = - D_w $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ a_E = \\frac{\\partial r_P}{\\partial T_E} = - D_e $$\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be seen that the signs of the coefficients are correct according to Rule 2 from the previous lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this descretization we can form an algebraic system of equatons at each control volume, i.e. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ a_P\\delta T_P + a_W \\delta T_W + a_E \\delta T_E = - r_P $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing a similar equation for each cell in the domain, a linear system can be derived that has a form as depicted in the following figure:\n",
    "\n",
    "![LinearSystem](Figures/2-LinearSystem.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "It may be noticed that the first and last row only have two non-zero entries instead of three. This is because these rows correspond to control volumes adjacent to the domain boundaries, which require boundary conditions to be applied. This will be discussed in more detail later.\n",
    "\n",
    "In matrix notation, we are solving the linear system:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $A$ is the Jacobian matrix and $\\mathbf{b}=-\\mathbf{r}$ is the negative of the residual vector. The solution, $\\mathbf{x}=\\delta\\mathbf{T}$ is the solution correction. With each iteration, the solution is updated according to the relation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathbf{T} = \\mathbf{T}_i + \\delta\\mathbf{T}_i $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the subscript $i$ refers to the current iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Source Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "The source term can take on a variety of different forms, depending on the type of heat source being modelled. In this lesson, and the associated assignment, we will focus on external convection and radiation exchange.\n",
    "\n",
    "For external convection:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{S_{conv,P}}{V_P} = - h A_o (T_P - T_{\\infty, c}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $h$ is the convection coefficient, $A_o$ is the external surface area of the cell $P$, $T_P$ is the temperature at the centroid of cell $P$, and $T_{\\infty, c}$ is the ambient temperature for the convection process. Note that the negative sign appears since heat is leaving the control volume when $T_P > T_{\\infty, c}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For radiation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{S_{rad}}{V_P} = - \\epsilon\\sigma A_o (T_P^4 - T_{\\infty,r}^4) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\epsilon$ is the surface emissivity, $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and $T_{\\infty, r}$ is the surroundings temperature for radiation exchange.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Discussion of Discretization Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "### Temperature Profile Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "In computing the diffusive fluxes through the integration point faces, we implicitly assumed a piecewise-linear profile for the temperature, as shown below. This choice is natural, given that it ensures that the derivatives are defined at the integration points. This is required for flux consistency at control-volume faces, as required by Rule 1 in the previous lesson. For an assumed piecewise-constant profile, the derivatives would be undefined at the integration points, and fluxes would not be consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "![PiecewiseProfiles](Figures/2-PiecewiseProfiles.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For calculations of source terms, the piecewise-constant assumption is used, which implies a single value of the source term in each cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation of Linearization \n",
    "\n",
    "It is also worthwhile noting that linearization has been treated as part of the discretization scheme, since we have developed the equations in \"correction\" mode, where the solution of the linear system is actually the correction that needs to be applied to the previous iteration of the solution. This is in contrast to the method of Patankar, where the solution of the linear system is the solution for the variables at the control volume centres. Although the methods can be shown to be equivalent, the correction mode is preferred for two main reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- At convergence, the solution for the correction goes to zero, making zero a good intial guess for the linear solver.\n",
    "- The residual vector is computed as a part of forming the linear system. Since the residual vector is needed to assess convergence, there is some additional computation required in the Patankar method for this calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise:** Review the Patankar method for discretization of the steady diffusion equation considered, and compare with the method shown in these notes. This will be further discussed in class.\n",
    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties of the Discrete Algebraic Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to have the correct physical influence, the coefficients must have a particular sign. Specifically, $a_P$ must be positive, while $a_W$ and $a_E$ must be negative, according to Rule 2 in the previous lesson. To elaborate further on this concept, consider the case with no sources, where the discrete algebraic equation for the control volume $P$ is given as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ a_P\\delta T_P + a_W\\delta T_W + a_E\\delta T_W = - r_P $$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we assume that the solution is converged, then $r_P \\rightarrow 0$, resulting in: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ a_P\\delta T_P = - a_W\\delta T_W - a_E\\delta T_W $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, suppose that either $T_W$ or $T_E$ were perturbed. If either of these temperature were to rise, the correct physical effect would be for $T_P$ to also rise. Similarly, if either temperature were to drop, $T_P$ should also drop. Therefore, if $a_P > 0$, it is required that both $a_W < 0$ and $a_E < 0$ to ensure the correct physical effect. If this criterion is violated, it can be manifest as poor convergence (or divergence) of the numerical method or non-physical oscillation in the converged profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is further noted that the discrete algebraic equations are independent of units, i.e. $T + \\Delta T$ also satisfies the equations when there are no source terms, in accordance with Rule 4 in the previous lesson. This implies that temperatures in either Kelvin or Celsius will both satisfy the same algebraic equations. The same is true for certain source terms, such as convection, where a temperature difference is involved. For source terms like radiation, the equations are not independent of units.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise:** Show that $T + \\Delta T$ satisfies the same equations as $T$ when there are no source terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also demonstrate that the equations are conservative over any number of cells. Let us consider two cells, $P$ and $E$ (shown below), and add the discrete equations together.\n",
    "\n",
    "![CombinedCv](Figures/2-CombinedCv.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation for control volume $P$ at convergence ($r_P = 0$) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F^d_{e,P} - F^d_{w,P} - S_P V_P = 0 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "For control volume $E$ it is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F^d_{e,E} - F^d_{w,E} - S_E V_E = 0 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding these equations together gives:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F^d_{e,P} - F^d_{w,P} + F^d_{e,E} - F^d_{w,E} - S_P V_P - S_E V_E = 0 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is noted that $F^d_{e,P} = F^d_{w,E}$, since these terms represent the diffusive flux across the face shared by volumes $P$ and $E$. If these terms were not equal, it would imply that there was a fictituous energy source at the face, which is not reasonable. Cancelling out these terms gives the combined algebraic equation for control volumes $P$ and $E$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F^d_{e,E} - F^d_{w,P} - S_P V_P - S_E V_E = 0 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation clearly represents a balance of the total source term within the combined control volume with the net diffusive flux from that same control volume. Therefore, integral conservation has been demonstrated. This applies for any group of control volumes, including the entire domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The important feature of the discretization that lead to the integral conservation property was that $F^d_{e,P} = F^d_{w,E}$. In our discretization:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F^d_{e,P} = - k \\frac{T_E - T_P}{\\Delta x_{PE}} A_{e,P} $$\n",
    "$$ F^d_{w,E} = - k \\frac{T_E - T_P}{\\Delta x_{PE}} A_{w,E} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $A_{e,P} = A_{w,E}$ simply by the geometry of the grid, it is in fact the two-point finite difference estimation of the derivative that has lead to the fluxes being equal. This is because of the piecewise-linear assumption that was made in the discretization process. Had we chosen to fit a parabolic curve from each side to determine the derivatives, there is no assurance that the face fluxes would be equal, which would cause the solution not to be conservative. In other words, we would have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F^d_{e,P} = f(T_W, T_P, T_E) $$\n",
    "$$ F^d_{w,E} = f(T_P, T_E, T_{EE}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows that the flux through the common face depends on different cell temperatures, which cannot assure that the derivative from either side is consistent. This is illustrated in the diagram below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![ParabolicProfiles](Figures/2-ParabolicProfiles.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to solve this problem, we will need to implement Python classes that:\n",

    "- Store the computational grid, including all relevant dimensions and properties\n",
    "- Store the discretization coefficients\n",
    "- Compute boundary values\n",
    "- Compute diffusion fluxes and linearization coefficients\n",
    "- Solve the linear algebraic system resulting from the discretization (mostly implemented using [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org) libraries)\n",

    "## Class Defining a One-Dimensional Cartesian Grid\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to solve any sort of problem using the finite volume method, we need to start with a grid on which we discretize our equations. As such, any computational code typically must start by defining some sort of data structure to store the grid quantities, along with code to calculate relevant grid parameters. The problem presently being solved requires just a simple one-dimensional Cartesian grid, as implemented in the code cell below. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, every class must include a method called ``__init__``, which is invoked any time a new instance of the class is created. This method is commonly called a *constructor*, since it is used to construct a new object.\n",

Although Python does not prevent access to these private member variables like other compiled languages (e.g. C++), it is a good practice to mark them as such, to warn users of the class that they should not be accessing these members (risking unexpected behaviour if they do). Also, this class has several methods marked with the [`@property` decorator](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#property). This allows users of the class to read the private member variables with controlled access. Here, no methods are provided to set these values, only those to get them.

For convenience, functions are also included to return arrays containing the face areas on the east and west sides of each control volume (i.e. `Aw` and `Ae`).

    "In addition to providing a class that defines the grid, it is useful to implement a class that can be used to store the terms that are used to form the linear system that is to be solved. While raw arrays could be used for this purpose, an object-oriented design is preferred because it allows us to provide some extra functionality, such as the function `zero` which zeros all of the arrays. This design also prevents us from having to pass around a lot of arrays to functions, since all of the arrays are grouped together in this class. Read through the implementation below to understand how the coefficients are stored, how the user can access them, and how they can be modified."

We use the residual to determine the state convergence, since the residual approaches zero as the flux balance within the cell becomes increasingly well satisfied (see Lesson 1, regarding the linearization process). The overall residual can be measured in multiple ways including the maximum residual, or the mean residual, defined as:\n",

If lowering the convergence criterion has no significant effect on the solution, then the user knows that further iteration is not required.\n",
